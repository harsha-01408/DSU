Edge Strength

You are given a weighted tree with N nodes and N-1 edges.

E is defined as summation F(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.
Also, F(i, j) is equal to the maximum value of the edge that is present on the simple path between node i and j.

You are required to determine the value of E.

---

Input format:
• The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in a tree.
• The next N-1 lines contain three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting an edge 
  between node u and node v with weight w.

Output format:
• Print the required value of E.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5
1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ u, v ≤ N

Example 1:
Input:
3
1 2 10
1 3 2

Output:
22

Explanation:
F(1,2) = 10
F(1,3) = 2
F(2,3) = 10
E = 10 + 2 + 10 = 22

Example 2:
Input:
5
1 2 4
2 3 1
1 4 6
4 5 12

Output:
75

Explanation:
F(1,2) = 4
F(1,3) = 4
F(1,4) = 6
F(1,5) = 12
F(2,3) = 1
F(2,4) = 6
F(2,5) = 12
F(3,4) = 6
F(3,5) = 12
F(4,5) = 12
E = 75
